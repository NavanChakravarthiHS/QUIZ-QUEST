# QUIZ QUEST
project 

PROBLEM STATEMENT
Traditional quiz administration methods—whether paper-based or manually managed
online forms—often suffer from inefficiencies, lack of security, and limited scalability.
Organizers face challenges in creating, distributing, and evaluating quizzes, while students
encounter inconsistent access, delayed feedback, and unclear submission protocols.
There is a pressing need for a centralized, role-based quiz management system that:
• Enables organizers to create and manage quizzes with defined constraints.
• Allows students to securely access quizzes using unique keys.
• Automates submission handling, including auto-submission for incomplete attempts.
• Instantly displays results to both organizers and students, ensuring transparency
and efficiency.

AIM
The Quiz Application project is to solve these challenges by developing a robust platform
that streamlines the entire quiz lifecycle from creation to result generation while
maintaining data integrity, user accountability, and a seamless user experience.

OBJECTIVES
The Objectives of our project are:
• Implement flexible quiz timing that provides two timing modes:
– A fixed overall time for the entire quiz, where students can manage their own
time.
– A per-question timer that enforces strict timing for each question.
• Prevent Duplicate Participation: By integrating authentication and participation
tracking, the system ensures that no student can attempt the same quiz more
than once.
• Ensure Cheat-Free Environment: Features like tab-switch detection and disabling
multiple screen usage will minimize cheating, making the quiz more reliable
and fair.
• Enable Auto Submission: If a participant fails to submit their answers before
the timer ends, the system will automatically submit the attempted responses to
avoid data loss.
• Support Multiple Question Types and Secure Access: The platform will
support both single-answer and multiple-answer type questions. Additionally, a
random access key will be generated for each quiz, ensuring that only authorized
students can participate.

SCOPE
• Secure and Efficient Platform: Provides a safe, reliable, and user-friendly system
for conducting online quizzes.
• Quiz Creation and Management: Allows organizers to create, manage, and
monitor quizzes with flexible timing and multiple question formats.
• Fair Participation: Ensures fairness by:
– Preventing duplicate entries.
– Restricting tab switching during quizzes.
– Enforcing automatic submission on time expiry.
• Scalable Access: Supports multiple students participating simultaneously without
performance degradation.
• Authorized Access: Generates unique access keys to ensure only authorized users
can join the quiz.
• Versatile Question Types: Supports both single-choice and multiple-choice questions
for varied assessments.
