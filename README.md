## 🚩 Problem Statement

Traditional quiz administration methods—whether paper-based or manually managed online forms—often suffer from inefficiencies, lack of security, and limited scalability.  
Organizers face difficulties in creating, distributing, and evaluating quizzes, while students experience inconsistent access, delayed feedback, and unclear submission protocols.

To overcome these challenges, this project introduces a **centralized, role-based Quiz Management System** that:
- Enables organizers to create and manage quizzes with defined constraints.  
- Allows students to securely access quizzes using unique keys.  
- Automates submission handling, including auto-submission for incomplete attempts.  
- Instantly displays results to both organizers and students.
